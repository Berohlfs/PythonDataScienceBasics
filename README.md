# Python Data Science Basics

Welcome to the **Python Data Science Basics** repository! üöÄ This repo serves as a foundational guide for beginners and enthusiasts who want to explore the exciting world of Data Science using Python. It covers essential concepts such as data preparation and data mining, ensuring a solid grasp of key techniques in the field.

## üìÇ Contents

### `./DataPreparation`
Data preparation is a crucial step in any data science workflow. This directory contains notebooks and scripts focused on:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalization, scaling and more.
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding data distributions and identifying patterns with visualizations.

### `./DataMining`
Data mining is where the magic happens! This section delves into techniques for extracting valuable insights from data, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies.
- **Clustering & Classification**: Implementing K-Means, Decision Trees, and other ML models.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying complex datasets with PCA and more.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Finding hidden relationships in large datasets.

## üõ† Setup (Jupyter Notebook)

To get started with the repository, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. Create a folder and open it inside the terminal.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open Jupyter in your browser, allowing you to run and edit notebooks interactively.

## ‚ö° A Bit About Python's Execution

Python is often referred to as an **interpreted language**, but there's more to the story!

### üî• Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages
- **Compiled languages** (like C, C++) convert source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster runtime performance but requiring platform-specific binaries.
- **Interpreted languages** (like Python, JavaScript) execute code line by line, making development more flexible and cross-platform but typically slower.

### üèé Python: The Hybrid Approach
Python is unique because it **compiles to bytecode** before interpretation:
1. **Compilation Step**: Python code is first converted into **bytecode** (.pyc files), an intermediate form that is not machine code.
2. **Execution Step**: The Python Virtual Machine (**PVM**) interprets the bytecode and executes it.

This approach allows Python to maintain flexibility while optimizing execution. Additionally, different implementations like **Jython** (for Java bytecode) and **IronPython** (for C# bytecode) enable Python to run in diverse environments.
